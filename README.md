marvell-switch
==============
Reference design drivers for marvell gigabit switch chips:  
88E6161  
88E6165  
88E6172  
88E6176  
88E6351  
88E6*?  

It might support every 88E6* around (look in dsdt/msApiDefs.h to see what I mean).
Pulled from Belkin's nasty, scary, patch found here: http://patchwork.openwrt.org/patch/5367/
